                    I recently graduated from a Web Development course at 
                    General Assembly where I increased my typing speed from 
                    10 words per minute on my type writer to 100 words per 
                    minute on my new MacBook Pro. They also taught me how to 
                    be an awesomeWeb Developer. During my spare time, I 
                    enjoy senior water aerobics, pickling, and spending time 
                    with my great grand children.
